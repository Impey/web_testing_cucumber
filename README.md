# BBC website testing with cucumber
### Description
This work tests the login page for the bbc website by achicveing all possible states that can be reached on the page apart from succesful logins. This test was left out as multiple requests using a valid login would lead to the account being locked from the site which is a unwanted outcome. The tests have been achieved by using cucumber with the gherkkin syntax of given, when, and then which reads as plain english so anyone can understand what the scenarios are trying to acheive. The work is structured using the page object model design pattern. This means when another page is to be tested it is treated as its own object allowing for more efficent and understandable code when it comes to testing a new page.
